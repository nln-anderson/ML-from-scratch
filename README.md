# ML-from-scratch
A personal project of building machine learning tools from the ground up. The purpose is to get a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of machine learning, as well as develop better coding skills. I expect many of the tools to come directly from assignments I completed in Foundations of Machine Learning at the University of San Diego.
